# Dungeon Crawler
## Rules
  - Every turn you will see a dungeon map, your current location(** sign) and allowed moves
  - Choose one of the available directions to move or enter whole string of directions to chain your moves
## Setup
You can choose one of these three ways:
 - Just download the project from github and open it in your IDE (Pycharm or VSC for example). Set up the interpreter and just run the program.
 - Or again download and run it from console like this: "python main.py"
 - Or you can check a little bit simplified version being deployed here: https://trinket.io/python3/3814cd48c6  (however keep in mind that if you are idle for too long kernel is being shut down and you need to rerun)
